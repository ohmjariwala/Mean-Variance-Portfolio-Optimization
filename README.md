# Mean-Variance-Portfolio-Optimization

•	Developed a Python script using YFinance to fetch historical asset data for a diverse multi-asset portfolio ranging from stock to crypto asset classes and minimized total portfolio risk by implementing the Mean Variance Portfolio Optimization algorithm.

•	Utilized Pandas and NumPy libraries to calculate the inverse matrix and covariance matrix, enabling efficient calculations for optimal asset weights, resulting in a 10% rise in returns compared to an evenly weighted portfolio.
